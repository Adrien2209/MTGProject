# MTGProject

## Presentation

The objective of this project is to implement the knowledge you have acquired during the teaching of object-oriented programming applied to the C++ language. In this project you will have to write a specification in the form of a class diagram with comments, in order to understand what you have to develop before starting the programming step.

The goal of this project is to create an extremely simplified version of the Magic the Gathering trading card game. For players, the Magic the Gathering Arena application is free on smartphones, and this site explains the rules in detail.

For our simplified version here is what to remember. Magic is a game where two players compete against each other. Each player starts with 20 life points, and his objective is to bring the life points of the other to zero. To do this, he has cards at his disposal. The set of all his cards is called his deck, and is initially located in the library (the set of cards he can still draw). 

At At the beginning of the game each player draws 7 cards. One player is drawn at random and will be the first player. Then a round proceeds as follows:

1. Draw phase: the active player draws a card from his or her library (the first player in his or her first turn does not do this phase. on his first turn does not do this phase, otherwise it takes place all the time). If a player cannot draw a card (his library is empty) he loses the game!

2. Disengage Phase: The active player disengages all his cards (lands and creatures for us).

3. Main phase: the active player can play as many cards from his hand as he wants by paying the cost. He will then put creatures into play.

4. Combat Phase: The active player chooses some of his creatures to attack the opponent. The opponent can use his own creatures to block.

5. Secondary Phase: The active player can play as many cards from his hand as he wants, paying the cost.

6. End of turn and change of active player: if a player has 8 or more cards in his hand, he must discard (put some in the graveyard) to have only 7 in his hand.
